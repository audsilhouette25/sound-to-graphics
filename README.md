<summary><h2>📖 About the Research</h2></summary>

While speech captions are well-established, non-verbal sound captions (e.g., *"[suspenseful music]"*) often fail to convey the intuitive "texture" and temporal dynamics of audio. 

**"Beyond Parentheses"** proposes a parametric visual modality that translates auditory features into dynamic motion graphics. We utilize an **Interactive Machine Learning (IML)** approach, allowing users to correct the AI's interpretation and fine-tune the visualization model to match their subjective perception.
